📘 javascript-exercism

This repository contains my JavaScript practice solutions from the Exercism platform.
The goal of this project is not only to complete exercises, but to build a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, and develop clean, readable code while learning through practice.

🎯 Purpose of this repository

- Strengthen core JavaScript knowledge
- Practice logical thinking and problem decomposition
- Get comfortable reading and understanding technical instructions in English
- Learn and apply important concepts such as:
  - functions
  - arrays and objects
  - loops
  - conditionals
  - callbacks
  - closures
  - object and array destructuring

🧠 Notes for reviewers

Some solutions intentionally reflect my learning process
Not all implementations aim to be the most optimized version
The focus is on clarity, correctness, and understanding, not shortcuts

🚀 Next steps
This repository is part of my ongoing preparation for more advanced studies in Full-Stack Web Development, including real-world applications and frameworks.

💼 About me

I am currently focused on building a strong foundation in JavaScript, with an emphasis on problem-solving, clean code, and core language concepts.
This repository reflects my hands-on learning process and continuous improvement through practice.

My goal is to transition into a Full-Stack Developer role, where I can apply solid fundamentals, learn new technologies efficiently, and contribute to real-world projects.
I value consistency, curiosity, and understanding the reasoning behind each solution.
